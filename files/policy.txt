I dont track you

This website uses GitHub Pages for hosting
Apart from that its just html and css

Thats all. The less you use the better.
If you want to start with privacy check out these guides:

Personally I use firefox with these modifications:

- https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js - Firefox config file optimised for privacy
- https://startpage.com - https://duck.com https://searx.space - Privacy focused search engines
- https://ublockorigin.com/ - Ad/tracker blocker
- https://bitwarden.com/ - Bitwarden password manager
- https://decentraleyes.org/ - CDN decentraliser
- https://sereneblue.github.io/chameleon/ - User agent spoofer, I have it set to periodically shuffle

It is also worth disabling webrtc, geolocation etc

If you need a VPN I would reccommend https://mullvad.net/
